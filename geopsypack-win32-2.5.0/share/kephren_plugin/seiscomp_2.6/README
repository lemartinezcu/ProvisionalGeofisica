Copy 220_Kephren directory into your seiscomp data structure
(assumed to be in ~/seiscomp):

  cp -r 220_kephren ~/seiscomp/acquisition/templates/source

Eventually change 220 to another number if it already exist.
Kephren plugin will appear automatically in the list of available

Edit streams.xml and add StreamProcessor for kephren_plugin listed
in kephren_streams.xml

  vi ~/seiscomp/acquisition/templates/streams.xml

220_kephren is very close to mseedscan
