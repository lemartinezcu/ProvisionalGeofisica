This folder contains various examples to compute dispersion curves.

1. From 'test.model', you can compute it with 'gpdc' command line (which makes use of this library).
   The following command output the fundamental and the 1st higher mode of Rayleigh. See option
   '-h' for more details.

  gpdc test.model -R 2 -n 30

2. Using a Fortran code. Set the correct paths in 'Fortran/Makefile' and run 'make'

  cd Fortran
  vi Makefile
  make
  ./gpdcfor

3. Using a C code. Set the correct paths in 'C/Makefile' and run 'make'

  cd C
  vi Makefile
  make
  ./gpdcc
